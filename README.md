## 📖 What is dsgekit?

dsgekit is a toolkit for working with DSGE models, which are used in economics to study how economies behave over time. It helps you:

- Read and understand model files  
- Solve both simple and complex economic systems  
- Run simulations to see how changes affect the economy  
- Analyze economic policies and their impact on welfare  

Even if you don’t have a background in programming, dsgekit offers tools to explore these economic models through a clear and manageable interface.

- Operating System: Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.14 (Mojave) or later, Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+ recommended)  
- Processor: Intel Core i3 or better  
- RAM: Minimum 4 GB, 8 GB or more recommended for large models  
- Disk Space: At least 500 MB free  
- Internet: Needed to download the package and updates  

You do not need to install a programming environment; the package includes the necessary tools to run the software.

## 🔍 Using dsgekit

Here’s a simple guide to begin using dsgekit after installation:

### 1. Open dsgekit

Click the dsgekit icon on your desktop or in your applications menu.

### 2. Load a Model

The main screen has an option to open a model file. Models have the `.dsge` or `.txt` extension.

- Click **Open Model**.  
- Select the file on your computer you want to analyze.  

If you don’t have a model file, sample models are included with the software under the "Samples" folder.

### 3. Solve the Model

Once the model is loaded, choose the “Solve” option. dsgekit will compute and display the results for the system. You can choose between linear or nonlinear solving methods.

### 4. Run Simulations

With the model solved, you can simulate different economic scenarios:

- Choose simulation parameters like shocks or policy changes.  
- Click “Run Simulation” to view how the model reacts.  

Graphs and tables will show the predicted effects over time.

### 5. Policy and Welfare Analysis

Use the built-in tools to run policy experiments and see their welfare impacts. This section allows you to compare policies and assess economic outcomes.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Tips

- If dsgekit does not start after installation, restart your computer, then try again.  
- Check that your system meets the minimum requirements listed above.  
- If you see error messages when loading model files, ensure the file format is compatible (`.dsge` or `.txt`).  
- For simulation errors, try running smaller or simpler models first to confirm stability.
